guide to set up mysql docker for your locate use

1, if there is not mysql docker image in your docker,
Please pull the latest one with this command

docker pull mysql:latest
__________________________________________________________________________


2, After downloaded the images
Please use this command to run the images:


docker run -id \
-p 3308:3306 \
--name=group40_mysql \
-v $PWD/conf:/etc/mysql/conf.d \
-v $PWD/logs:/logs \
-v $PWD/data:/var/lib/mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=sad \
mysql:latest \
--character-set-server=utf8mb4 \
--collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci


This command will make the port mapping with mysql(3306) and the host(3308)

The Mysql username and password are set as bellow:
username: root
password: root

It will make a database schema in mysql named: sad
we are going to create tables in the sad schema

It also create some share folders between mysql and the host.

__________________________________________________________________________

3. After those two commands, please go to java/resources/application.properties
look for this statement:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3308/sad

change the IP as you need.
if you are using docker on your PC, then it do not need to be changed



__________________________________________________________________________

4, Run the program.
open the browse with this address: http://localhost:8080/
you will see: "A starter for Group40 project"

Check if the sad schema has created tables(admin, demo, event, stream) automatically

if it does, your setting is all done
if not, let me know if you have any questions.
